/**
 * # Playwright Browser Orchestrator <-> HTTP bridge
 *
 * This script exposes the Playwright Browser orchestrator through a HTTP server. This is useful
 * for orchestrating a browser through Behat BDD tests in PHP, while still using the modern Playwright
 * tooling, instead of the arcane Selenium.
 *
 *
 * ## Usage from the outside
 *
 * For full documentation how this script is used from inside Behat, see PlaywrightTrait.php.
 *
 *
 * ## Internal Documentation
 *
 * As long as the server is running, a Chrome browser instance is running as well.
 *
 * Different tests should use different [Browser Contexts](https://playwright.dev/docs/core-concepts#browser-contexts) for separation - which
 * we expose through the HTTP API.
 *
 * We assume this all runs in a TRUSTED ENVIRONMENT, as it allows SENDING ARBITRARY JAVASCRIPT to this server
 * which is then evaluated.
 *
 * The server exposes the following API endpoints:
 *
 * - POST /exec/[contextName]
 *   - In case the "contextName" is existing, it is continued to be used. Otherwise, a new Playwright BrowserContext is created.
 *   - the BODY is the JavaScript which should be executed (in plain text). You have access to the following variables:
 *     - `context` is the Playwright [BrowserContext](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-browsercontext) object
 *     - `vars` is a writable JS Object (`{}`) which you can use to pass information from one call to `/exec/[contextName]` to the next.
 *       Simple `const myVar` variable declarations are NOT preserved to the next invocation (because I do not know how ;).
 *   - The REPLY is sent as soon as the step has completed; so that means we wait until everything has run - the API behaves SYNCHRONOUSLY.
 *     - In case of an error, a 500 status code is sent.
 *     - In case of success, a 200 status code is sent.

 *     The response format is always structured as JSON like this:
 *     {
 *         error: null, // string, only filled if an error occured
 *         returnValue: // mixed: the return value of the current command (if any)
 *         js: // string: the full JS executed so far in this playwright context. ready to be pasted into the playwright runner
 *     }
 *
 * - POST /stop/[contextName]
 *   - Removes the context, i.e. the allocated `BrowserContext` and variable bag; effectively closing the browser window associated.
 *
 * EXAMPLE usage:
 *
 * curl http://127.0.0.1:3000/exec/t1 --data-raw 'vars.page = await context.newPage();'
 * curl http://127.0.0.1:3000/exec/t1 --data-raw 'await vars.page.goto("http://spiegel.de");'
 * curl -XPOST http://127.0.0.1:3000/stop/t1
 *
 *
 * NOTE: if this all works out as we hope, this should probably become part of a custom PHP package or so.
