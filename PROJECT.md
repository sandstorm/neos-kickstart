## Setting up IntelliJ

- recommended plugins:
    - Neos Support
    - Makefile language
    - PHP
    - PHP Annotations
    - PHP Toolbox
    - Prettier
        - make sure Prettier is activated for the correct extensions
    - Docker
    - Behat Support
- check, if autocompletion works for .yaml-files
- check, if it's possible to jump to Fusion Prototypes via cmd + click

## Requirements

- docker for mac
- node -> to run Playwright Tests or for local development (without docker) of your sites JavaScript

## Local Development Setup (only required once)

This should only be needed when running the project for the first time.

- run `git lfs install` and `git lfs pull` to get large files like the content dump (you need to install git-lfs on your
  machine)
- run `./devs.sh setup`, this will also install the Dev Script Runner. You can now use `dev <some-taks>` from anywhere inside the project.
- for font awesome pro support in local dev
    - open: `app/DistributionPackages/MyVendor.AwesomeNeosProject/Resources/Private/.npmrc.sample`
    - and do what the file tells you ;)

## Local Development

- run `dev start` to start all needed container of the project (see `docker-compose.yml` for details)
- run `dev site-create` once to create your new site package or import one
- run `dev logs` and `dev log-flow-exceptions` to see what's going on in the containers
- run `dev logs-assets` to see the logs of scss being compiled to css and ts being compiled to js
    - alternatively you can install node dependencies and run the watcher locally
    - `cd app/DistributionPackages/MyVendor.AwesomeNeosProject/Resources/Private/`
    - `nvm install && nvm use && yarn && yarn run watch`
    - see `package.json` for more scripts
- run `dev` to see all available commands
- run `dev <sometaks> --help` to get detailed help for a task
- run `dev open-site` you can login to the [neos backend](http://localhost:8081/neos) with the credentials `admin` and `password`

## Packages we recommend for certain use-cases

1. `sitegeist/monocle` for prototyping components
2. `yoast/yoast-seo-for-neos` for a real good SEO experience
3. `flowpack/nodetemplates` adds possibility to auto-generate content to newly created nodes -> helps with the editor
   experience
4. `neos/form-builder` + `neos/form` + `neos/form-fusionrenderer` to let editors build forms or to create powerful
   static form node-types
5. `sandstorm/lightweightelasticsearch` (more customizable) or `flowpack/searchplugin` (simple out of the box) to
   implement a search
6. `sitegeist/LostInTranslation` to get AI translated content on the fly via Deepl
7. or have a look at the recommendations on neos.io: https://www.neos.io/features/feature-list.html

## Staging

TODO!

### Debugging Emails

Swiftmailer is installed and configured to use Mailhog (local SMTP server) in development mode. You can visit the
Mailhog Web-UI at [http://localhost:8025/](http://localhost:8025/).

## Running Tests

Make sure the application is up and running `dev start`. Make sure you build the testrunner
with `cd ./e2e-testrunner && nvm use && npm install`

- for E2E Test
    - in a new console run `cd ./e2e-testrunner node index.js` to start the e2e-testrunner
    - in a new console run `dev run-e2e-tests` to run the actual tests
- for Unit Tests run `dev run-unit-tests`
- for Functional Tests run `dev run-functional-tests`

### debug failing tests

1. see screenshots in `./e2e-testrunner`
2. reports can be viewed by installing playwright once globally (`npm install -g playwright`) and run the traces via

```
npx playwright show-trace e2e-testrunner/report_YOUR_FAILING_STEP.zip
```

#### run single BDD feature files / scenarios

The `dev run-e2e-tests` command runs **all tests** what is handy before you push your commits. Often, in TDD it is more
practical to run single feature files or scenarios. That has to be done via command line, since the IntelliJ
integration "play button" does not work for our docker setup (afaik).

How to run single feature files (see also README of Sandstorm.E2ETestTools):

```
docker compose exec neos bin/behat -c Packages/Sites/MyVendor.AwesomeNeosProject/Tests/Behavior/behat.yml.dist -vvv Packages/Sites/MyVendor.AwesomeNeosProject/Tests/Behavior/Features/Frontend/404-page.feature
```

#### Generating content (node) fixtures workflow:

1. set up your test content that you want to export in the Neos backend (using the default local dev port `8080`)
2. write new commands for exporting specific pages
   in `\MyVendor\AwesomeNeosProject\Command\StepGeneratorCommandController` to export only specific nodes for your
   fixtures
3. Run and copy to clipboard with:

```
docker compose exec -T neos ./flow stepgenerator:homepage | pbcopy
docker compose exec -T neos ./flow stepgenerator:notfoundpage | pbcopy
```

4. paste into your feature files and run tests

### setup tests in IntelliJ

for auto-completion and IDEA support of your BDD Tests do the following steps:

1. make sure, you installed "Behat Support" Plugin
